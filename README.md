# Aqueduct-System-in-Console
In this project we are going to make a console application that can to simulate the basics operations in a aqueduct, for example: the all CRUD with the users that have a aqueduct by class, invoice inventory, users who consume more water in the aqueduct, users who pay more for water.

On the other hand console application is going to allow that administrator can to make a request for a new water meter and update, delete readings water meters that created by inspectors and also charge for water consumed.
